# DIP-assignment

Actual work so far is in process1.py and process_02.py

Can ignore process_01.py; i used it for testing methods that I copy-pasta'd from online. :P 

Write ONE program  with different methods for each:
Drawing info with no table lines to separate the words
- 08 
Drawing info with table lines and small boxes 
- 05, 06, 07, 09, 12, 13, 19
Drawing info with table lines but no small boxes 
- 01, 02, 03, 04, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20
